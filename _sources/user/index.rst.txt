User Guide
==========

EmployeeDB has three different user types:

* Admin
* Normal User
* Visitor

If you are just a visitor or logged in as a normal user, the currently added information can be viewed.
If logged in as an admin, new employees, job titles, levels, services, workcharts, transportations can be added, or currently added information can be edited or deleted.
