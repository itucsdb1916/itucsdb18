================================
For EmployeeDB, I have worked on the tables PERSON, SERVICE, TRANSPORTATION
and their related functions.

Database Design
---------------
* The "PERSON" table contains the available person along with their properties like their name, age, gender, height, and weight.
* The "SERVICE" table contains the available services for employees along with their properties like its town, capacity, current passenger amount, licence plate and departure hour.
* The "TRANSPORTATION" table contains the current transportation information which maps the name of the employee to their services, seat number, service fee, stop name, whether they use it in the morning or evening.

Database Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    def add_employee(self, employee):
        adds a new employee
        returns: employee_key

    def delete_employee(self, employee_key):
        deletes an employee

    def update_employee(self, employee_key, name, age, gender, height, weight):
        updates an existing employee
        returns: employee_key

    def get_employee(self, employee_key):
        get a single employee by its key
        returns: employee_

    def get_employees(self):
        get all employees and add them to a list
        returns: employees
    
    def get_employee_id(self, employee_name):
        returns the id of an employee by its given name
        returns: employee_id 

* These are the functions about employees, for all CRUD operations as well as getting the employee id for the foreign key operations.

    def add_service(self, service):
        adds a new service
        returns: service_key

    def delete_service(self, service_key):
        deletes a service

    def update_service(self, service_key, town, capacity, current_passengers, licence_plate, departure_hour):
        updates an existing service
        returns: service_key
    
    def get_service(self, service_key):
        get a single service by its key
        returns: service_
    
    def get_services(self):
        get all services and add them to a list
        returns: services

    def get_service_id(self, service_name):
        returns the id of a service by its given name
        returns: service_id  

* These are the functions about services, for all CRUD operations as well as getting the service id for the foreign key operations.

    def add_transportation(self, transportation):
        adds a new transportation
        returns: transportation_key

    def delete_transportation(self, transportation_key):
        deletes a transportation

    def get_transportation(self, transportation_key):
        get a single transportation by its key
        returns: transportation_

    def get_transportations(self):
        get all transportations and add them to a list
        returns: transportations

    def update_transportation(self, personid, serviceid, uses_in_morning, uses_in_evening, seat_nr, service_fee, stop_name):
        updates an existing transportation
        returns: transportation_key

* These are the functions about transportation, for all CRUD operations as well as getting the names of employees and towns of services from their id values from the foreign key operations.
